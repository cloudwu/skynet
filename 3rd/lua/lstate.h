/*
** Some notes about garbage-collected objects: All objects in Lua must
** be kept somehow accessible until being freed, so all objects always
** belong to one (and only one) of these lists, using field 'next' of
** the 'CommonHeader' for the link:
**
** 'allgc': all objects not marked for finalization;
** 'finobj': all objects marked for finalization;
** 'tobefnz': all objects ready to be finalized;
** 'fixedgc': all objects that are not to be collected (currently
** only small strings, such as reserved words).
**
** For the generational collector, some of these lists have marks for
** generations. Each mark points to the first element in the list for
** that particular generation; that generation goes until the next mark.
**
** 'allgc' -> 'survival': new objects;
** 'survival' -> 'old': objects that survived one collection;
** 'old1' -> 'reallyold': objects that became old in last collection;
** 'reallyold' -> NULL: objects old for more than one cycle.
**
** 'finobj' -> 'finobjsur': new objects marked for finalization;
** 'finobjsur' -> 'finobjold1': survived   """";
** 'finobjold1' -> 'finobjrold': just old  """";
** 'finobjrold' -> NULL: really old       """".
**
** All lists can contain elements older than their main ages, due
** to 'luaC_checkfinalizer' and 'udata2finalize', which move
** objects between the normal lists and the "marked for finalization"
** lists. Moreover, barriers can age young objects in young lists as
** OLD0, which then become OLD1. However, a list never contains
** elements younger than their main ages.
**
** The generational collector also uses a pointer 'firstold1', which
** points to the first OLD1 object in the list. It is used to optimize
** 'markold'. (Potentially OLD1 objects can be anywhere between 'allgc'
** and 'reallyold', but often the list has no OLD1 objects or they are
** after 'old1'.) Note the difference between it and 'old1':
** 'firstold1': no OLD1 objects before this point; there can be all
**   ages after it.
** 'old1': no objects younger than OLD1 after this point.
*/

/*
** Moreover, there is another set of lists that control gray objects.
** These lists are linked by fields 'gclist'. (All objects that
** can become gray have such a field. The field is not the same
** in all objects, but it always has this name.)  Any gray object
** must belong to one of these lists, and all objects in these lists
** must be gray (with two exceptions explained below):
**
** 'gray': regular gray objects, still waiting to be visited.
** 'grayagain': objects that must be revisited at the atomic phase.
**   That includes
**   - black objects got in a write barrier;
**   - all kinds of weak tables during propagation phase;
**   - all threads.
** 'weak': tables with weak values to be cleared;
** 'ephemeron': ephemeron tables with white->white entries;
** 'allweak': tables with weak keys and/or weak values to be cleared.
**
** The exceptions to that "gray rule" are:
** - TOUCHED2 objects in generational mode stay in a gray list (because
** they must be visited again at the end of the cycle), but they are
** marked black because assignments to them must activate barriers (to
** move them back to TOUCHED1).
** - Open upvales are kept gray to avoid barriers, but they stay out
** of gray lists. (They don't even have a 'gclist' field.)
