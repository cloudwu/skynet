HISTORY for LPeg 0.12

* Changes from version 0.11 to 0.12
  ---------------------------------
  + no "unsigned short" limit for pattern sizes
  + mathtime captures considered nullable
  + some bugs fixed

* Changes from version 0.10 to 0.11
  -------------------------------  
  + complete reimplementation of the code generator
  + new syntax for table captures

  + better error messages
  + Notation for non-terminals in 're' back to A instead o <A>
  + experimental look-behind pattern

  + consumes less C stack

  - "and" predicates do not keep captures

* Changes from version 0.8 to 0.9
  -------------------------------
